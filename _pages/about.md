Before starting her career in journalism, she worked as a police officer for the Korean National Police. She graduated from the Korean National Police University with a focus on law and criminal investigation.

She participated in several international projects, including the OCCRP-led Russian Laundromat and [Troika Laundromat](https://www.icij.org/blog/2019/03/troika-laundromat-reveals-russian-banks-8-8bn-offshore-scheme/), as well as the [Paradise Papers](https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/), [Panama Papers](https://www.icij.org/investigations/panama-papers/), and the [Implant Files](https://www.icij.org/investigations/implant-files/) project led by ICIJ.

An international investigation of [pseudo-scientific publications](https://www.icij.org/blog/2018/09/undercover-reporters-expose-bogus-scientific-conferences/) led by Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR), in which she took part, won several domestic journalism awards.
